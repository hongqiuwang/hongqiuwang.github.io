<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size=3> I am a PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I am under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/indexlzhu/home" style="color: #B22222;">Lei Zhu</a> and co-supervised by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZfzEFpsAAAAJ&hl=en" style="color: #B22222;">Guang Yang</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size=3>My research is dedicated to advancing AI for healthcare, including multi-modal learning to integrate diverse clinical data into insights, active learning to empower seamless deployment and practical application of AI algorithms, and fairness to guarantee equitable care.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><font size=3>My original aspiration is to leverage these advancements to improve patient access to quality healthcare and enhance their overall well-being. Even if I can contribute just a little, I would find deep fulfillment in that.</font></p>
